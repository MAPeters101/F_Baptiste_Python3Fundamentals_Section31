Question 1
Alongside this notebook is a file daily_quotes.csv (the same one that we used for the Pandas exercises).

Using this data write a function that generates a composite of line charts (2 columns wide), that charts the closing price for each symbol in the data.

Question 2
Expand on your previous function to include an n-day moving average on each chart. (When you calculate the moving average, be careful with the order of the data in each subset of data).

Question 3
Using the previous charts, add horizontal lines for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the close price (calculated over the entire time period).
